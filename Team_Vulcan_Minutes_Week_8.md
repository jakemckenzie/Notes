# Team Vulcan Minutes Week 8

## Minutes

For week 8 we demo'd what we had working on the robot so far and what has been integrated
then split up who was going to work on what parts going forward

* Ammon needs to get serial communication working between the pi and the arduino. Ammon has successfully integrated all of Alex's 
part and jake's orientation capture algorithm which are working in about 2 seconds together, correctly and accurately 99% of the time, 
if there are no shadows.
* Alex Marlow is mostly done with his part and is getting placed with Ammon and Jake to work on getting the pi side 
done fixing odds and ends. He has successfully gotten the object detection down to 2 to 2.5 seconds on the pi.
* Jake needs to needs to get the perspective transformation working. He has completed and tested the orientation capture 
which is working correctly on the pi and is fully integrated.
* Brooke has finished the hand orientation and goto position on the arduino side. She will be working with boyle going forward on 
integration and helping boyle out.
* Boyle is working on dead wreckoning and serial communication.

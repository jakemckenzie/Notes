#Season 2 of The Wire
Obedience can be expensive in an environment of uncertainty. 
Institutions fail when they can't change up, when they can't 
respond to fluctuation in the game. The Lindy effect isn't complete 
bullshit, there's something to be said for institutions who, 
having survived for a bit continuing to survive a while longer. 
This season is a testament to, in more ways than one, the argument 
against that observation. Whether it be the failure of the wire to 
bring down the Barksdale organization, the failure of the docks to 
respond to a changing word, the failure of McNulty fixing his marriage,
 the failure of the Barksdale organization to respond to having 
 an inferior product or even a failure of 
the Greek's crime syndicate to run their own operations. 
The second season of the wire is one big cluster fuck. It's a look 
at when institutions fail. At each stage it is their conformity to what 
got them to where they were that failed each institution. The two key 
non-governmental institutions that tried their best to change up, 
to respond to the challenges they faced, one in the Barksdale organization 
in Stringer Bell or the dock worker's union in Frank Sobotka, it wasn't 
enough. They weren't creative enough in responding to the challenges they faced.
Stringer would have lost all of what Avon fought for sooner if he hadn't 
changed up and Sobotka would have lost the docks way sooner if he hadn't gotten 
into dirt. In both cases it still wasn't enough. Creativity, not seniority, 
is the name of the game. It may be what gets you hours at the docks but it isn't 
what will make your institution survive in an aggressive world.
